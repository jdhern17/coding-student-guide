# Homework Workflow 📝

## 1. Initialize Remote Repo

- When beginning a homework assignment, I recommend starting with creating a GitHub repository with a README.md file. You can then perform `git clone` to copy the empty repo to your local machine.
    - NOTE: `git clone` will create a subdirectory that is your repo.
    - NOTE: If you begin with `git init`, be sure you are in the correct folder that you would like to turn into a repo, such as a new folder created specifically for this assignment or the Develop folder containing the homework's starter code.
- There should also be instructions within the **04-Important** folder of the first unit folder within your class repository titled, **Steps To Upload to Github**.

> Pro-Tip: I also recommend that all of your projects be stored in a **Projects** folder from within your user's root directory.
>
> - On a Mac: /Users/(username)/Projects
> - Windows: C:\Users\\(username)\Projects

## 2. Find Starter Code

- Navigate to your Class Repository.
- For most bootcamps, the Class Repo is structured as:

> Class-Code >> ##-Unit-Name >> 02-Homework >> Develop

- Aside from the first few homework assignments, the Develop folder has important starter code to support your progress in the assignment.
- If you are in a virtual bootcamp, your starter code should be located within your modules.

## 3. Copying Starter Code into Local Repo

- Once you have a local version of the repo, copy or drag all the files from the Develop folder into this new local folder.
- Once the starter code files are copied, perform the `git add`, `git commit`, and `git push` steps.

> Pro-Tip: Do not upload to or change files directly in GitHub. This creates a new commit automatically and will conflict with your local machine's commit history if you do not run `git pull` locally.
