# Google Search & Top Websites

## Tips for Troubleshooting and Searching

- If you're spending more than 20-30 minutes on an issue or project goal...Google it!
- Always include the applicable language in the Google search (ex. JavaScript, react, mysql).
- If you are seeing a specific error in the console or on the page, copy the non-user-specific parts directly into the Google search.
- Use the following framework to assess a search result's applicability:
  - Is this article using the same tech stack?
  - Is this article within a similar level of complexity as to my current knowledge or goal? As in, is 60-80% of the code recognizable?
  - Is this article at least 75% related to my current issue or goal?
- If an article has passed the test above, then carefully review the material from the top.
- It's okay to have to look up unfamiliar terms in another tab while you work through the main article, as long as the amount of unfamiliar terms stays within the 60-80% recognizable range.

Lastly, if you get stuck and are spending more than a few hours on an issue or goal:
- Reach out to a classmate, TA or instructor!
- Ask your SSM about the AskBCS Learning Assistant tool!
- Reach out to your tutor!
