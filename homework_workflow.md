# Homework Workflow

## 1. Initialize Repo

- When beginning a homework assignment, I strongly recommend starting with creating a GitHub repository.
- There should be instructions within the **04-Important** folder of the first unit folder within your class repository titled, **Steps To Upload to Github**.

> Pro-Tip: I also recommend that all of your projects be stored in a **Projects** folder from within your user's root directory.
>
> - On a Mac: /Users/(username)/Projects
> - Windows: C:\Users\\(username)\Projects

## 2. Find Starter Code

- Navigate to your Class Repository.
- For most bootcamps, the Class Repo is structured as:

> Class-Code >> ##-Unit-Name >> 02-Homework >> Develop

- Aside from the first few homework assignments, the Develop folder has important starter code to support your progress in the assignment.
- If you are in a virtual bootcamp, your starter code should be located within your modules.

## 3. Copying Files from Develop

- Once you have a repo cloned into your **Projects** folder, copy all the files from the Develop folder into this new repo.
- Once the starter code files are copied to their destination, perform the `git add`, `git commit`, and `git push` steps.
