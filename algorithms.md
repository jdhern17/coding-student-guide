# Algorithms

Practicing algorithms is an important tool to keep you prepared for many different interview types you may encounter.

## Algorithms folder

- Each week in your curriculum is an algorithm problem for you to solve. While you are in the bootcamp, start there.

## [Algorithms with Abdul Bari](https://youtu.be/0IAPZzGSbME)

- Once you complete the algorithm problems from within the bootcamp folder, Abdul Bari's Algorithms videos can further strengthen your ability to handle interview questions such as "What is the time complexity of this algorithm?"

## [LeetCode](https://www.leetcode.com)

- Once you have a solid foundation for understanding algorithms and their complexity analysis, head over to LeetCode and start practicing more challenging algorithms.
- Filter the problems by easy and JavaScript.
